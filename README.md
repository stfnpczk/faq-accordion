## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM notation
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Aligning and taking into account the different overlays of the images keeps being challenging.

<br>

- `<details> disclosure` : element used to show (hide) info, toggling open(close) state


<br>

### Continued development

In a further iteration, I'll add some animation to the opening/closing of the detail element and add some js making it close, when an other detail item is clicked.
